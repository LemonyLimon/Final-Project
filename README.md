## Program Specifications 
This program needed to meet the following criteria:
1. Contains appropriate addresses: origination, fill, array, input and output.
2.  Displays values in console.
3.  Uses appropriate labels and comments.
4. Contains appropriate instructions for arithmetic, data movement and conditional operations.
5. Comprises of 2 or more subroutines and implement subroutine calls.
6.  Uses branching for control: conditional and iterative.
7.  Can manage overflow and storage allocation.
8.  Includes a PUSH/POP stack
9.  Includes a save-restore operations
10.  Includes a pointer
11. Implement ASCII conversion operations
12. Use appropriate system call directives.
13. Testing - test the program using the values: 52, 87, 96, 79, 61

## Purpose of Program
To create an LC-3 program that will dsiplat the maximum, minimum, average score, and the letter grade. (0-50=F, 60-69=D, 70-79=C, 80-89=B, 90-100=A).

## Program Instructions: 
1. Download the project.asm file.
2. Open an LC3 editor and assemble the .asm file into an .obj file.
3. Open a simulator and run the .obj file.
4. Enter in 5 test scores between (0-99). After the last test score is entered the program will output the max, min, and the average score.
5. Program will ask if you would like to rerun program or terminate.
